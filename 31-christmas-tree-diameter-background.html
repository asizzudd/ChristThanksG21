    <p>The value of christmas trees from denmark and norway has fallen. A christmas tree adorned with twinkling lights and ornaments is an essential holiday decoration. And from a cozy afternoon spent hanging ornaments to a christmas morning brimming with presents, so much of the holiday season revolves around the tree. Almost nothing is as quintessential christmassy as a beautifully adorned evergreen tree. If only the holidays could last throughout the winter months—the twinkling lights and christmas cookies make the cold and dark so much more bearable.</p>
