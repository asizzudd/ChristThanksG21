    <p>My daughter is super picky and has her own ideas of how to decorate, so my goal was to make sure it was a tree that she loved and felt proud of. I used a mix of warm red, pink, and burgundy ornaments with a dash of peacock feathers, metallic floral pics, pink feathers, and poinsettias. This space has come a long way in five years. Once we finally got a christmas tree for our bedroom i wondered what took so long. This year i kept things much more minimalistic but i love it just the same.</p>
